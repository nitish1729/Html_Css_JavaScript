<p1>The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.For example, when a user clicks over the browser, add js code, which will execute the task to be performed on the event.In JavaScript, this event can apply to launch a particular function when the page is fully displayed. It can also be used to verify the type and version of the visitor's browser. We can check what cookies a page uses by using the onload attribute.The difference between the document.onload and window.onload is: document.onload triggers before the loading of images and other external content. It is fired before the window.onload. While the window.onload triggers when the entire page loads, including CSS files, script files, images, etc.In this example, there is a div element with a height of 200px and a width of 200px. Here, we are using the window.onload() to change the background color, width, and height of the div element after loading the web page.
The background color is set to 'red', and width and height are set to 300px each.In this example, we are implementing a simple animation by using the properties of the DOM object and functions of javascript. We use the JavaScript function getElementById() for getting the DOM object and then assign that object into a global variable.

<p>The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler to a particular element. It does not override the existing event handlers. Events are said to be an essential part of the JavaScript. A web page responds according to the event that occurred. Events can be user-generated or generated by API's. An event listener is a JavaScript's procedure that waits for the occurrence of an event.The addEventListener() method is an inbuilt function of JavaScript. We can add multiple event handlers to a particular element without overwriting the existing event handlers.useCapture: It is an optional parameter. It is a Boolean type value that specifies whether the event is executed in the bubbling or capturing phase. Its possible values are true and false. When it is set to true, the event handler executes in the capturing phase. When it is set to false, the handler executes in the bubbling phase. Its default value is false.In HTML DOM, Bubbling and Capturing are the two ways of event propagation. We can understand these ways by taking an example.Suppose we have a div element and a paragraph element inside it, and we are applying the "click" event to both of them using the addEventListener() method. Now the question is on clicking the paragraph element, which element's click event is handled first.The onresize event in JavaScript generally occurs when the window has been resized. To get the size of the window, we can use the JavaScript's window.outerWidth and window.outerHeight events. We can also use the JavaScript's properties such as innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, ClientHeight, offsetWidth, offsetHeight to get the size of an element.In HTML, we can use the onresize attribute and assign a JavaScript function to it. We can also use the JavaScript's addEventListener() method and pass a resize event to it for greater flexibility.</p>
