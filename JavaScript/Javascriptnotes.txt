What is JavaScript
JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
....................................
   3 Places to put JavaScript code
   ................................
1.Between the body tag of html
2.Between the head tag of html
3.In .js file (external javaScript)

JavaScript Comment
There are two types of comments in JavaScript.
Single-line Comment ----// It is single line comment  
Multi-line Comment-------/* your code here  */

"""""JavaScript Variable"""
var:-  If we declare a Variable from var, then we can also declare it again with the same name, and if we want to re-again its value then we can do that too;

let :-If we declare a Variable from let, then we can not declare it again with the same name, but we can re-again its value;

const:- And if we declare Variable with const, we can neither declare it again nor can re-again its value;


/// Javascript Data Types
      /*
       JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
       Primitive data type
       Non-primitive (reference) data type

       JavaScript primitive data types
       Data Type
       String:- represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
       Number:- represents numeric values e.g. 100
       Boolean:-	represents boolean value either false or true
       Undefined:-	represents undefined value
       Null:=	represents null i.e. no value at all


       JavaScript non-primitive data types
       Object:- represents instance through which we can access members
       Array:-	represents group of similar values
       RegExp:-	represents regular expression

                  Operators

There are following types of operators in JavaScript.
Arithmetic Operators
Comparison (Relational) Operators
Bitwise Operators
Logical Operators
Assignment Operators(Compound operators)
        

JavaScript Functions
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.
Advantage of JavaScript function
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.

Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
Less coding: It makes our program compact. We donâ€™t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.

JavaScript Function Syntax
The syntax of declaring function is given below.
function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
 //code to be executed  
}  


Function with Return Value

// JavaScript Events
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. 
 there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser
 When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.

 Mouse events:
 click:-	onclick-	When mouse click on an element
 mouseover	onmouseover	When the cursor of the mouse comes over the element
 mouseout	onmouseout	When the cursor of the mouse leaves an element
 mousedown	onmousedown	When the mouse button is pressed over the element
 mouseup	onmouseup	When the mouse button is released over the element
 mousemove	onmousemove	When the mouse movement takes place.

 1.onclick 
 2.oncontextmenu
 3.ondblclick
 4.onmousedown
 5.onmouseup
 6.onmouseover
 7.onmouseout
 

 Keyboard events:
Keydown & Keyup onkeydown & onkeyup	When the user press and then release the key
1.onkeydown
2.onkeyup
3.onkeypress

                Window/Document events
